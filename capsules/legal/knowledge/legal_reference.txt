# Contract law principles, NDA components, clause analysis guidelines

## Key Components of a Valid Contract

1. **Offer**: A clear proposal made by one party to another.
2. **Acceptance**: Unequivocal agreement to all terms of the offer.
3. **Consideration**: Something of value exchanged between parties.
4. **Capacity**: All parties must have legal capacity to contract.
5. **Legality**: The contract's purpose must be lawful.
6. **Mutual Assent (Meeting of the Minds)**: Both parties must understand and agree to the essential terms.


## Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) — Essential Elements

### Definition of Confidential Information
- Should be clearly defined and specific
- Common approaches: marked/designated information, or broad categorical definition
- Standard exceptions: publicly known, independently developed, received from third party, required by law

### Obligations of Receiving Party
- Non-disclosure: Do not reveal to unauthorized parties
- Non-use: Use only for the stated purpose
- Standard of care: Usually "reasonable measures" or "same care as own confidential info"
- Need-to-know: Limit access to those who require it

### Duration
- Obligation period: Typically 2-5 years from disclosure
- Perpetual NDAs: Common for trade secrets, unusual for general business info
- Survival clause: Obligations that continue after agreement termination

### Mutual vs Unilateral
- Mutual NDA: Both parties share and protect information (common in partnerships/negotiations)
- Unilateral NDA: One party discloses, the other protects (common in employer/employee)


## High-Risk Contract Clauses to Flag

### Indemnification
- **One-sided indemnification**: Only one party bears risk — flag as unfair
- **Uncapped indemnification**: No limit on liability — high risk for indemnifying party
- **Best practice**: Mutual indemnification with carve-outs and caps

### Limitation of Liability
- **Cap amount**: Should be reasonable (common: 12 months of fees paid)
- **Exclusions**: Usually carves out willful misconduct, IP infringement, confidentiality breach
- **Consequential damages waiver**: Standard but review scope carefully

### Termination
- **Termination for convenience**: Either party can exit with notice (30-90 days typical)
- **Termination for cause**: Requires material breach and cure period (30 days typical)
- **Automatic renewal**: Flag if there's no exit window

### Non-Compete / Non-Solicitation
- **Geographic scope**: Must be reasonable (varies by jurisdiction)
- **Duration**: Generally 1-2 years; some jurisdictions limit to 1 year
- **California**: Non-competes generally unenforceable (Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code § 16600)
- **New York**: Enforced if reasonable in scope, geography, and duration

### Intellectual Property Assignment
- **Work-for-hire**: Created IP belongs to the hiring party
- **Assignment clause**: Transfers ownership of created IP
- **Pre-existing IP**: Should be explicitly excluded from assignment
- **Future inventions**: Broad future invention clauses may be unenforceable in some states


## Jurisdiction-Specific Notes

### United States
- Contract law is primarily state law (not federal)
- UCC Article 2 governs sale of goods
- Common law governs services contracts
- Choice-of-law clauses generally enforceable
- Delaware: Preferred for corporate agreements (Court of Chancery expertise)
- New York: Common for financial/commercial contracts
- California: Strong consumer protections, non-compete restrictions

### European Union
- GDPR applies to all contracts involving EU personal data
- Consumer contracts subject to EU Consumer Rights Directive
- Rome I Regulation governs choice of law in contractual obligations
- Unfair Terms Directive may override agreed terms in B2C contracts

### India
- Indian Contract Act, 1872 governs general contracts
- Stamp duty varies by state and contract value
- Arbitration governed by Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996
- Non-competes during employment: generally unenforceable (Section 27, ICA)
- Non-competes post-employment: enforceable only if reasonable

### Cross-Border Considerations
- Identify which country's courts have jurisdiction
- Consider enforcement of judgments across borders
- Include dispute resolution mechanism (arbitration preferred for cross-border)
- ICC or SIAC arbitration commonly used for international commercial disputes
