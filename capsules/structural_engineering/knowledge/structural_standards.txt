## AISC 360-22 Key Provisions

### Chapter F — Design of Members for Flexure
The nominal flexural strength Mn shall be the lower value obtained from the limit states of yielding (plastic moment) and lateral-torsional buckling.

For compact sections bent about their major axis:
- Yielding: Mn = Mp = Fy × Zx
- Where Fy = specified minimum yield stress, Zx = plastic section modulus

### Chapter E — Design of Members for Compression
The nominal compressive strength Pn shall be determined based on the limit state of flexural buckling:
- For KL/r ≤ 4.71√(E/Fy): Pn = [0.658^(Fy/Fe)] × Fy × Ag
- For KL/r > 4.71√(E/Fy): Pn = 0.877 × Fe × Ag
- Where Fe = π²E/(KL/r)², K = effective length factor, r = radius of gyration

### Chapter J — Design of Connections
Bolt shear strength: Rn = Fn × Ab
- Where Fn = nominal shear stress, Ab = nominal bolt area
- For A325 bolts: Fn = 457 MPa (threads excluded), 372 MPa (threads included)


## IS 456:2000 Key Provisions

### Clause 26.5.1 — Minimum Reinforcement in Beams
The minimum area of tension reinforcement shall not be less than:
As,min = (0.85 × b × d) / fy
Where b = breadth, d = effective depth, fy = characteristic strength of steel

### Clause 40.1 — Shear Strength of Concrete
Design shear strength τc depends on percentage of longitudinal tension reinforcement and concrete grade.
For M20 concrete: τc ranges from 0.36 MPa (0.25% steel) to 0.80 MPa (3% steel)

### Clause 23.2 — Deflection Limits
Basic L/d ratios for serviceability:
- Cantilever: 7
- Simply supported: 20
- Continuous: 26


## IS 800:2007 Key Provisions

### Clause 7.1 — Design Strength Due to Yielding
Td = Ag × fy / γm0
Where Ag = gross area, fy = yield stress, γm0 = 1.10 (partial safety factor)

### Clause 7.3 — Design Strength Due to Block Shear
Tdb = [Avg × fy / (√3 × γm0) + 0.9 × Atn × fu / γm1]
or [0.9 × Avn × fu / (√3 × γm1) + Atg × fy / γm0]  — whichever is smaller


## Common Load Combinations (IS 875)

### Ultimate Limit State
1. 1.5 × (DL + LL)
2. 1.2 × (DL + LL + WL)
3. 1.5 × (DL + WL)
4. 0.9 × DL + 1.5 × WL (for overturning)

### Seismic Combinations (IS 1893)
1. 1.5 × (DL + EQ)
2. 1.2 × (DL + LL + EQ)
3. 0.9 × DL + 1.5 × EQ

Where DL = Dead Load, LL = Live/Imposed Load, WL = Wind Load, EQ = Earthquake Load
