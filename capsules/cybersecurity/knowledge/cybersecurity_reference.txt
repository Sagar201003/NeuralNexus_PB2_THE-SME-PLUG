## MITRE ATT&CK — Key Tactics and Techniques

### Tactic: Initial Access (TA0001)
- T1566 — Phishing: Adversaries send phishing messages to gain access. Subtechniques:
  - T1566.001 — Spearphishing Attachment: Malicious files sent via email.
  - T1566.002 — Spearphishing Link: Malicious URLs in email body.
  - T1566.003 — Spearphishing via Service: Phishing through social media or messaging.

### Tactic: Execution (TA0002)
- T1059 — Command and Scripting Interpreter:
  - T1059.001 — PowerShell: Malicious PowerShell commands/scripts.
  - T1059.003 — Windows Command Shell: cmd.exe abuse.
  - T1059.004 — Unix Shell: Bash/sh script execution.

### Tactic: Persistence (TA0003)
- T1547 — Boot or Logon Autostart Execution:
  - T1547.001 — Registry Run Keys: Adding entries to HKCU/HKLM\...\Run.
- T1053 — Scheduled Task/Job: Creating scheduled tasks for persistence.

### Tactic: Privilege Escalation (TA0004)
- T1548 — Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism:
  - T1548.002 — Bypass User Account Control (UAC).
- T1068 — Exploitation for Privilege Escalation: Using software vulnerabilities.

### Tactic: Defense Evasion (TA0005)
- T1070 — Indicator Removal:
  - T1070.001 — Clear Windows Event Logs.
  - T1070.004 — File Deletion to remove artifacts.
- T1027 — Obfuscated Files or Information: Encoding/encrypting payloads.

### Tactic: Lateral Movement (TA0008)
- T1021 — Remote Services:
  - T1021.001 — Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP).
  - T1021.002 — SMB/Windows Admin Shares.
  - T1021.004 — SSH lateral movement.
- T1570 — Lateral Tool Transfer: Moving tools between systems.

### Tactic: Exfiltration (TA0010)
- T1048 — Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol:
  - T1048.001 — Exfiltration over symmetric encrypted non-C2 protocol.
  - T1048.003 — DNS tunneling for data exfiltration.


## NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 5 — Selected Controls

### Access Control (AC)
- AC-2: Account Management — Establish conditions for group/role membership.
- AC-3: Access Enforcement — Enforce approved authorizations.
- AC-6: Least Privilege — Employ the principle of least privilege.
- AC-17: Remote Access — Establish usage restrictions for remote access.

### Audit and Accountability (AU)
- AU-2: Event Logging — Identify events that need auditing.
- AU-3: Content of Audit Records — Ensure records contain sufficient information.
- AU-6: Audit Record Review, Analysis, and Reporting — Review logs regularly.

### Incident Response (IR)
- IR-1: Incident Response Policy and Procedures.
- IR-4: Incident Handling — Implement incident handling capability.
- IR-5: Incident Monitoring — Track and document incidents.
- IR-6: Incident Reporting — Report incidents to appropriate authorities.
- IR-8: Incident Response Plan — Develop and maintain IR plan.

### System and Information Integrity (SI)
- SI-2: Flaw Remediation — Identify, report, and correct flaws.
- SI-3: Malicious Code Protection — Implement anti-malware.
- SI-4: System Monitoring — Monitor system for attacks and indicators.


## CVSS v3.1 Severity Ratings

| Score Range | Severity  | Response Time  |
|-------------|-----------|----------------|
| 9.0-10.0    | Critical  | Immediate      |
| 7.0-8.9     | High      | < 24 hours     |
| 4.0-6.9     | Medium    | < 1 week       |
| 0.1-3.9     | Low       | Next patch cycle |
| 0.0         | None/Info | Informational  |


## Common Incident Response Steps (NIST SP 800-61)

1. **Preparation**: Establish IR capability, tools, procedures.
2. **Detection & Analysis**: Monitor alerts, validate incidents, determine scope.
3. **Containment**: Short-term (isolate) and long-term (patch/rebuild).
4. **Eradication**: Remove malware, close attack vectors, reset credentials.
5. **Recovery**: Restore systems, verify integrity, monitor for recurrence.
6. **Lessons Learned**: Post-incident review, update procedures, improve defenses.


## Common Log Sources for SOC

| Source           | Key Events                                  |
|------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Firewall         | Block/allow, geo-anomalies, port scans     |
| IDS/IPS          | Signature matches, anomaly alerts           |
| SIEM             | Correlated events, threshold alerts         |
| Endpoint (EDR)   | Process execution, file changes, registry   |
| DNS              | Query logs, tunneling indicators            |
| Active Directory | Login failures, account changes, Group Policy|
| Email Gateway    | Phishing attempts, attachment blocks        |
| WAF              | SQLi, XSS, directory traversal attempts     |
